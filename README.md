## Market-Depth-Calculator
**Tool to measure DOM in crypto**

The calculation for market depth is simply the cumulative volume of the base asset at various percentages from the 
mid price. For example, the “Bid Volume 10%” for BTC/USD on Coinbase would represent the volume of all bids for BTC 
falling within 10% of the mid price at which the order book snapshot was taken.
